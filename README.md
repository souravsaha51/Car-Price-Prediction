# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—


## Introduction
<p> A machine learning model can be used to predict used car prices by considering a variety of factors.The model can be trained on a dataset of historical car sales data, and it can then be used to predict the price of a car based on its features.
 The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models

<h1><a name="projectobjectives">Project ObjectivesðŸ’¡</a></h1>
  #### The main objective of  this project are:
*  To develop an efficient and effective model which predicts the price of a used car according to userâ€™s inputs.
*  To achieve good accuracy.
*  To develop a User Interface (UI) which is user-friendly and takes input from the user and predicts the price.


## DataSet
<p> This project utilizes a structured dataset in CSV format, detailing used cars with features like mileage, brand, age, and fuel type. Each row represents a car and its price. Proper preprocessing and cleaning of this data are crucial for accurate machine learning modeling and effective price prediction.</p>
 
## Project Overview
The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in used car price prediction using linear regression. The steps include:
* Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Linear Regression Model: Training the linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
* Price Prediction: Using the trained model to predict prices for new used car instances.


## Conclusion
 The model we were making is to predict the value of a used car using machine learning techniques. We have collected the data of cars from Kaggle having attributes like different cars and their year, km driven, fuel type, model name, company etc.
