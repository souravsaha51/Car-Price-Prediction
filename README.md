# Car Price PredictionðŸš—

## Project Objectives :
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing price.


## Introduction
* The project aim to predict rental house prices in Bangalore city, Karnataka. By combining Data Science techniques with web development skills, weâ€™ve created a valuable resource for potential home buyers and real estate enthusiasts. 
* Linear Regression is the choosen Algorithm for the fundamental technique in predictive model. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting housing prices.
* The purpose of deploying this project is to gain practical knowledge in the field of Data Science and to make the fundamental strongs. The project provide many new information about the Data Analysis, Outlier Detection and Removal and many more. 

## Introduction
The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in used car price prediction using linear regression. The steps include:

* Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Linear Regression Model: Training the linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
* Price Prediction: Using the trained model to predict prices for new used car instances.

The notebook includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid in understanding the used car price prediction process using linear regression.
