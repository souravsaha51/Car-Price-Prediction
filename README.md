# Car Price PredictionðŸš—

## Project Objectives :
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing price.


## Introduction
* The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models
* Linear Regression is the choosen Algorithm for the fundamental technique in predictive model. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting housing prices.
* The purpose of deploying this project is to gain practical knowledge in the field of Data Science and to make the fundamental strongs. The project provide many new information about the Data Analysis, Outlier Detection and Removal and many more. 

## Project Overview
The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in used car price prediction using linear regression. The steps include:

* Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Linear Regression Model: Training the linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
* Price Prediction: Using the trained model to predict prices for new used car instances.

The notebook includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid in understanding the used car price prediction process using linear regression.


## Conclusion
* The model we were making is to predict the value of a second- hand car using machine learning techniques. We have collected the data of cars from Kaggle having attributes like different cars and their year, km driven, fuel type, model name, company etc.
